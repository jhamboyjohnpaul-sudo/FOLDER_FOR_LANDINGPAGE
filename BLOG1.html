        <h1>A Typical Life of an IT Student</h1>

        <div class="section">
            <p>
                <strong>Have you ever wondered what it's like to be an IT student behind the screens?</strong>
                <em>Good day!</em> I am <strong>John Paul Jhamboy</strong>, a simple <em>BSIT student</em> who
                didn't see myself in this kind of field or program ever before, because I am a student who is
                always <strong>hesitant when it comes to making certain decisions</strong> about myself, especially
                in selecting my program which I'm passionate about. That is why I fell into the
                <strong>BSIT program as not my first choice</strong>. But the <em>dedication and resilience</em>
                that arose within me is what inspired me to <strong>keep pursuing what I had begun</strong>.

                <strong>First year in college</strong> gave me goosebumps and <em>unexplainable emotions</em>
                because when I was in high school, <strong>college is what I feared the most</strong> due to the
                high-level way of teaching. <em>Socializing with new and mature classmates</em> caused me
                difficulties in building friendships. The <strong>another level of lessons</strong> pushed me
                to think critically because of various processes and logic. <strong>Being an IT student is far
                from easy</strong>; every day introduces a different kind of challenge. I experienced
                <em>heavy workloads</em> such as assignments, projects, and laboratory tasks that left me unsure
                where to begin. There was a time during my <strong>second year, first semester</strong> when I
                doubted myself and thought I couldn't handle this program. I even questioned if I should
                <em>shift to another course</em>, especially when dealing with <strong>programming logic and
                algorithms</strong>, particularly in <strong>Java</strong>. Despite these hardships, it opened
                opportunities for me to <em>learn, adapt, and grow</em>, developing my
                <strong>problem-solving, patience, and time management skills</strong>—not only for school,
                but also for real life.

        <div class="section">
            <p>
                <strong>What keeps me motivated</strong> through this demanding journey is the
                <em>joy of creating something purposeful</em>. I feel happy when the <strong>programs and codes</strong>
                I worked hard on finally run <em>smoothly and correctly</em>. These moments make me forget
                the <strong>late nights and tough struggles</strong>. Beyond coding, I believe that
                <em>technology is a powerful tool</em> capable of changing lives and industries. Knowing that
                the <strong>skills I develop every day</strong> can solve future problems keeps my
                <em>passion burning</em>. Learning from my professors and their <strong>innovative ideas</strong>
                also motivates me to <em>expand my boundaries</em> and grow as a person.

                Now that I am currently in my <strong>second year</strong>, I realized that
                <em>success in this career does not come easily</em>. It requires
                <strong>dedication, determination, constant practice</strong>, and the willingness to
                <em>learn from mistakes</em>. There are moments of frustration when codes fail and projects
                become overwhelming, but these struggles taught me
                <strong>resilience and perseverance</strong>. Every struggle becomes an
                <em>opportunity to improve and gain confidence</em>. My advice to students who plan to take
                the <strong>BSIT program</strong> is to <em>trust their decisions</em> and choose what they are
                truly <strong>interested and passionate about</strong>.
