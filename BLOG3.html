        <h1>A VISION BEYOND GRADUATION: MY FUTURE IN IT</h1>

                    I used to think of <strong>graduation as the finish line</strong> of my journey.
                    With a bit of reflection, I find graduation to be an even more important milestone,
                    as it marks <em>the beginning of an entirely new journey in life</em>. Bilang isang
                    IT student, I often ask myself a simple but important question: <strong>"What kind
                    of IT career do I want to be after graduation?"</strong> It has to be more than
                    securing a job. It has to be a career where I can <em>grow and solve real, meaningful
                    problems</em>. This blog captures my vision post-graduation, my aspirations, and 
                    <strong>the future that I aim to achieve in the IT industry</strong>.

                    I chose the pathway towards IT because I was <strong>curious about what happens in
                    technology beyond what is visible on screens</strong>. When I was in college, I
                    found out that IT is more than just writing code or doing computer repair; it is
                    actually dealing with <em>real-world problems</em> by means of <strong>logic,
                    creativity, and patience</strong>. After years, I can see myself working in a
                    specific company bilang isang <strong>Cybersecurity professional</strong>, since
                    nowadays, <em>data and systems are more valuable than ever</em> as hackers or
                    attackers are prevalent and cause threats and system breaches. I chose this
                    career to <strong>protect privacy, infrastructures, systems, and networks</strong>
                    mula sa mga taong nagnanais na i-exploit ang mga ito. I know that choosing this
                    path will give me hardships, but <em>persistence is needed in this field</em>.

                    My perspective has been <em>gently shifting from student to future professional
                    Cybersecurity</em> habang papalapit ang graduation. I am aware that <strong>
                    mistakes and failures are a significant part of learning</strong>. Now, I am
                    concentrating on strengthening my <strong>technical and communication skills
                    </strong> dahil sa field na ito, ay hindi lang technical skills ang mahalaga
                    but also the <em>ability to communicate, collaborate, and build relationships</em>
                    inside the company na tutulong sakin to have good output results and smoother
                    workflow along with my colleagues. I want to work with a company where I can
                    <strong>gain real-world experience</strong> and <em>prove my worth as a trustworthy
                    Cybersecurity professional</em> na siguradong hahawak ng malaking responsibilidad.

                    As I look beyond graduation, aware ako na sa IT field ay kailangan ng <strong>dedication,
                    effort, and patience</strong>. Handa akong <em>mag-commit</em> kahit alam kong hindi
                    magiging madali ang kakaharapin ko sa field na ito. The most important lesson I learned
                    is that <strong>having a precise goal helps me stay focused</strong> throughout my college
                    journey, especially during challenging periods. I advise other students who share the same
                    situation na <em>wag magdoubt sa kanilang tinatahak</em> at piliin kung ano talaga ang gusto
                    nilang career before graduation to avoid career crisis. I view graduation as <strong>my
                    starting point in pursuing a long-term IT career</strong> that will continue until the
                    time that I choose to step away from it.
