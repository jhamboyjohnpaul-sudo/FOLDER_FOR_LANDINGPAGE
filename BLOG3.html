        <h1>A VISION BEYOND GRADUATION: MY FUTURE IN IT</h1>

        <div class="section">
            <p>
                I used to think of <strong>graduation as the finish line</strong> of my journey.
                With a bit of reflection, I find graduation to be an even more important milestone,
                as it marks <em>the beginning of an entirely new journey in life</em>. Bilang isang
                IT student, I often ask myself a simple but important question: <strong>"What kind
                of IT career do I want to be after graduation?"</strong> It has to be more than
                securing a job. It has to be a career where I can <em>grow and solve real, meaningful
                problems</em>. This blog captures my vision post-graduation, my aspirations, and 
                <strong>the future that I aim to achieve in the IT industry</strong>.

                I chose the pathway towards IT because I was <strong>curious about what happens in
                technology beyond what is visible on screens</strong>. When I was in college, I
                found out that IT is more than just writing code or doing computer repair; it is
                actually dealing with <em>real-world problems</em> by means of <strong>logic,
                creativity, and patience</strong>. After years, I can see myself working in a
                specific company bilang isang <strong>Cybersecurity professional</strong>, since
                nowadays, <em>data and systems are more valuable than ever</em> as hackers or
                attackers are prevalent and cause threats and system breaches. I chose this
                career to <strong>protect privacy, infrastructures, systems, and networks</strong>
                mula sa mga taong nagnanais na i-exploit ang mga ito. I know that choosing this
                path will give me hardships, but <em>persistence is needed in this field</em>.

                My perspective has been <em>gently shifting from student to future professional
                Cybersecurity</em> habang papalapit ang graduation. I am aware that <strong>
                mistakes and failures are a significant part of learning</strong>. Now, I am
                concentrating on strengthening my <strong>technical and communication skills</strong>
                dahil sa field na ito, ay hindi lang technical skills ang mahalaga
                but also the <em>ability to communicate, collaborate, and build relationships</em>
                inside the company na tutulong sakin to have good output results and smoother
                workflow along with my colleagues. I want to work with a company where I can
                <strong>gain real-world experience</strong> and <em>prove my worth as a trustworthy
                Cybersecurity professional</em> na siguradong hahawak ng malaking responsibilidad.

                magiging madali ang kakaharapin ko sa field na ito. The most important lesson I learned
                is that <strong>having a precise goal helps me stay focused</strong> throughout my college
                journey, especially during challenging periods. I advise other students who share the same
                situation na <em>wag magdoubt sa kanilang tinatahak</em> at piliin kung ano talaga ang gusto
                nilang career before graduation to avoid career crisis. I view graduation as <strong>my
                starting point in pursuing a long-term IT career</strong> that will continue until the
